- How do I apply your mutators to my goat?
[i]In the main menu of the game, select Custom Game, then you will see a list of all the mutators installed on your computer. Double click on the mutators you want in this list to add them to your goat.[/i]

- My game is crashing at startup, what do I do?
[i]Try to follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247411111]this guide[/url] and see if it fixed your problem. If not, I don't think I can do anything more sorry.[/i]

[quote=About this mod]After completing the Bouncing APM, I thought it would not be too hard to apply the same mechanism to the goat... I was wrong X)
The ragdoll actually uses the same method as the balls to bounce: I replaced the original object physics by the physics of a rubber. But when you are not ragdolled, I had to manually calculate the bounce effect every time you touch the floor ^^"[/quote]
